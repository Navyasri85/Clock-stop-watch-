Project Title: Clock

Description:
This project is a real-time digital clock built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It dynamically displays the current time (hours, minutes, and seconds) and updates every second without needing to refresh the page.
The clock runs entirely on the client side using JavaScript’s Date object, making it lightweight and efficient. The UI is styled with responsive CSS for a modern and clean look.

Features:
> Real-time updates (refreshes every second)
> 24-hour format
> Responsive and visually appealing design
> Lightweight – no backend
